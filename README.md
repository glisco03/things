## Overview

Things is a collection of random trinkets, items and features that I feel enhance the Vanilla experience in a non-instrusive way. Among its features are the 
*Enchanted Wax Gland* which lets you travel very quickly in water, the *Displacement Tome* which is essentially a Warp Book remake, the *Bater Wucket* which is an
infinite Water Bucket and many more

## Tags

These item tags are useful for server owners, modpack developers, or mod developers to configure Things further.

- `things:hardening_catalyst_blacklist`: prevents the item from being used with a Hardening Catalyst to make it unbreakable 
- `things:agglomeration_blacklist`: prevents the item from being crafted with an Agglomeration
- `things:displacement_tome_fuels`: decides what items can be used to charge a Displacement Tome
- `things:enchantable/retribution`: decides what items can be enchanted with Retribution
